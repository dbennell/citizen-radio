### some key points to cover

* **Why sidearms matter:** last-line defence in boarding actions, frontier wildlife control, mandated by UEE merchant-shipping regs (code 47-C).
* **Energy vs ballistic vs electron vs frag:** power-cell logistics, armor penetration, crowd-control trade-offs.
* **Top 5 pistols in-verse:**

  * *Klaus & Werner Arclight* — zero-recoil energy classic, security-force staple.
  * *Kastak Arms CODA* — .50 slug “hand cannon”, six-round punch through composite glass.
  * *Gemini S38* — 13-round polymer frame, cheap and ubiquitous among haulers.
  * *Kastak Arms Yubarev* — electron burst chains damage between clustered targets.
  * *Greycat Salvo Frag* — micro-grenade pistol; civilian-legal only outside atmo-regulated zones.
* **Recent tuning (Alpha 3.23):** effective-range normalization (ballistic ≈ 35 m, energy ≈ 25 m) and magazine/ammo repack changes.
* **New ammunition options:** Gemini Seeker fragmenting rounds; CODA tungsten penetrators for heavy undersuits.
* **Where to test during Invictus 2955:** Bevic Centre live-fire range opposite Hall C Idris hologram; rental kiosks allow side-by-side trials.
* **Buying & training advice:** rent before purchase, grip fit over caliber, carry ratio of mags to MedPens in boarding kits.
* **Cultural angle:** pistols as status symbols—engraved Arclights for corporate execs, CODA customs in Pyro pirate culture.
