# Create a 8 minute podcast about Invictus

host: Dex Rylan
guest: Regular contributor, Bro Logan
guest: Travel correspondent, Sam Cadillac


## Podcast Topic
Talk about your journies around the verse and what you found interesting... Top Gear Style


### Here are some ideas

Locales & Atmosphere: Use each world’s flavor. Hurston (Stanton I): A “rusted company town,” totally industrialized
. Great punchlines: “Hurston – come for the dust, stay because your contracts won’t let you go!” or “Lorville: tallest smokestack with city lights.” Crusader (Cl): A gas giant with floating orbital cities (Orison)

. DJ gags: “Life above the clouds – just pray your coffee doesn’t float away!” ArcCorp (III): A nearly fully built-over world

. Quips like “ArcCorp: If you need it, they’ve got it… probably on sale if you can find it” or “ArcCorp Tower, where the trust funders meet the factory floors” (Area18 is the big landing zone and even houses ArcCorp’s corporate HQ). microTech (IV): An ice-cold tech hub producing mobiGlas computers

 – “New Babbage: it’s always winter but at least your mobi won’t overheat.” Also note Stanton’s orbiting stations: Port Olisar (the old intro spot), Grim HEX (the pirate enclave), Covalex Shipping (for missions), Baijini Point (ArcCorp’s orbital mall), etc. Spaceport names offer one-liners: Hurston’s Teasa Spaceport (glowing blue sign over Lorville)

, Crusader’s spider-shaped August Dunlow Port

, ArcCorp’s Riker Memorial (hidden under clouds, look for the red runway)

 – all good for puns about finding your way in Stanton.
